BIOS Date 2023:

First install flashrom tool by looking it up in YaST.

Then use flashrom with internal programmer (not ideal) to do a full backup of bios/uefi using command below:
sudo flashrom -p internal -r backup.bin

You should see output below:
admin@openSuse:~/rom_backup> sudo flashrom -p internal -r backup.bin
flashrom v1.2 on Linux 6.4.0-150600.23.53-default (x86_64)
flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org

Using clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns).
Opened /dev/mtd0 successfully
Found Programmer flash chip "Opaque flash chip" (8192 kB, Programmer-specific) mapped at physical address 0x0000000000000000.
Reading flash... done.
admin@openSuse:~/rom_backup> ls
backup  backup.bin

Information about what project is can be found easily at link below:

Now You should store metadata somewhere as a backup. It will be very important to store it with a checksum.

After that You should be ready to start with modification and experimenting with bios and flashing an image.

To start You first should have a possibility to analyse binary file You have just obtained.
To do this You should first install binwalk. How to do this won't be covered in tutorial because the installation process will be different for different systems.
I did it in YaST software management tool - the easiest possible way to do this.
